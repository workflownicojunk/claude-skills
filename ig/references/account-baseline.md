## 1. API Credentials & Access

### Authentication

| Variable | Wert | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| `META_PAGE_TOKEN` | in `~/Desktop/.env` | AKTIV (getestet 13.03.2026) |
| `INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN` | in `~/Desktop/.env` | ABGELAUFEN (OAuthException 2500) |
| `INSTAGRAM_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID` | `17841408804651544` | @nicolstanzel |
| `META_PAGE_ID` | `489648017568050` | Facebook Page "Nicol Stanzel" |

### WICHTIG: Welchen Token verwenden?

**IMMER `META_PAGE_TOKEN` verwenden.** Der `INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN` ist ein User Token, der regelmäßig abläuft. Der `META_PAGE_TOKEN` ist ein Page Token, der langlebig ist und alle benötigten Rechte hat.

```bash
# RICHTIG:
source ~/Desktop/.env
curl "https://graph.facebook.com/v21.0/17841408804651544/media?fields=id,caption,media_type,timestamp&access_token=$META_PAGE_TOKEN"

# FALSCH (Token abgelaufen):
curl "...&access_token=$INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### Token Details

- App: Nicol Stanzel Instagram (App ID: `1712891086035275`)
- Typ: Page Token (langlebig, nicht ablaufend solange App-Berechtigungen bestehen)
- Scopes: `instagram_basic`, `instagram_manage_insights`, `pages_read_engagement`, `pages_show_list`
- Source: `source ~/Desktop/.env` (nie hardcoden)
- Backup: Apify (`APIFY_TOKEN` in .env) als Fallback, liefert aber keine Saves/Shares/Reach

### MCP Tool Reference

Available tools for live data retrieval. NEVER guess metrics; always call the API.

| Tool | Purpose | Key Parameters |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `mcp__claude_ai_Instagram_MCP__get_user_info` | Account profile, follower count, bio, media count | None (uses configured user ID) |
| `mcp__claude_ai_Instagram_MCP__get_user_media` | Fetch recent posts with metadata | `limit` (20-100, default 25) |
| `mcp__claude_ai_Instagram_MCP__get_post_insights` | Per-post engagement metrics | `media_id` (required) |
| `mcp__claude_ai_Instagram_MCP__get_user_insights` | Account-level aggregate metrics | `period` (use `days_28`), `metrics` list |

### Available Metrics by Endpoint

**Post Insights** (`get_post_insights`):
- `reach` - unique accounts that saw the post
- `saved` - number of saves
- `shares` - DM sends/shares
- `likes` - like count
- `comments` - comment count
- `total_interactions` - sum of all engagement actions
- `ig_reels_avg_watch_time` - average watch duration in seconds (Reels only)

**Account Insights** (`get_user_insights`, period=days_28):
- `reach` - 28-day unique reach
- `follower_count` - net follower change
- `total_interactions` - 28-day total engagement
- `likes`, `comments`, `shares`, `saves`, `views` - aggregated by period

**NOT available** via current API version:
- `plays` (use `views` instead)
- `impressions` (use `reach` as proxy)
- `profile_visits` (available only in native app insights)
- `website_clicks` (available only in native app insights)
- Reel completion rate (must calculate from avg watch time / reel duration)
- Individual story metrics via API (limited; check native app)

### Rate Limits

- 200 calls per user per hour (standard Graph API limit)
- Batch requests: up to 50 sub-requests per batch call
- For bulk analysis (100+ posts), paginate with `after` cursor; avoid fetching all at once
- If rate-limited (HTTP 429), wait 5 minutes before retrying
- Recommendation: for monthly audits, pull user_media in batches of 50, then insights per post

## 5. Save Rate Distribution

### Distribution Across 100 Analyzed Posts

| Save Rate Bucket | % of Posts | Avg Reach | Avg Likes | Typical Category |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| > 5.0% | [X]% | [range] | [range] | [categories] |
| 3.0-5.0% | [X]% | [range] | [range] | [categories] |
| 1.0-3.0% | [X]% | [range] | [range] | [categories] |
| < 1.0% | [X]% | [range] | [range] | [categories] |

### Save Rate as Algorithm Predictor

| Save Rate | Algorithm Effect | Action |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| > 5% | VIRAL: algorithm pushes to Explore, Reels feed, suggested | Reproduce exact format, hook structure, topic angle |
| 3-5% | STRONG: distributed beyond followers, steady growth | Optimize hook; content quality is there |
| 1-3% | AVERAGE: reaches followers + some Explore | Analyze what's missing vs. top performers |
| < 1% | IGNORED: algorithm suppresses distribution | Do not repeat this format. Diagnose and pivot |

### Save Rate Correlation with Reach

[Describe the correlation you observe in your data:]
- Correlation strength (r ~ [value] based on your post analysis)
- Estimated reach impact per +1% save rate: [~X additional reach]
- Save rate vs. likes/comments as reach predictor: [which is stronger?]
- Compounding effects with DM-sends: [describe observed interaction]

---

## 6. DM-Send Rate Analysis

### DM-Sends by Content Category

| Category | Avg DM-Sends | DM-Send Rate (per reach) | Correlation |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|-------------|
| [TOP CATEGORY] | [n] | [X]% | [Explanation] |
| [CATEGORY 2] | [n] | [X]% | [Explanation] |
| [CATEGORY 3] | [n] | [X]% | [Explanation] |
| [CATEGORY 4] | [n] | [X]% | [Explanation] |
| [CATEGORY 5] | [n] | [X]% | [Explanation] |

### DM-Send Triggers (What Makes People Hit "Send to Friend")

Identify the specific triggers that drive DM-sends for your audience:

1. [Trigger 1: describe the psychological moment that makes someone share]
2. [Trigger 2: topic specificity that triggers "my friend needs to see this"]
3. [Trigger 3: counterintuitive or surprising claims that demand discussion]
4. [Trigger 4: identity-specific content shared within peer groups]

### DM-Send Rate vs. Algorithm Impact

DM-sends are weighted 3-5x higher than likes in the 2026 algorithm:
- 1 DM-send ~ 3-5 likes in terms of algorithmic signal
- Posts with >0.3% DM-send rate consistently reach Explore
- DM-sends create a compounding effect: recipient views the post, potentially shares further

## 7. Posting Schedule (Data-Validated)

### Best Times ([your timezone])

Analyze your posting history to find optimal time slots.

| Priority | Time | Avg Likes | Sample Size | Notes |
|----------|------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | [time] | [avg] | [n] posts | [context] |
| 2 | [time range] | [avg] | [n] posts | [context] |
| 3 | [time range] | [avg] | [n] posts | [context] |
| AVOID | [time range] | [avg] | [n] posts | [context] |

Recommendation: [Describe which time slot to test more aggressively and why.]

## 8. Anti-Patterns

### The Controversial Post (Case Study)

Document your worst-performing post as a cautionary example.

Post [#]: [date]: [likes] likes, [comments] comments, [reach] reach, [saves] saves ([X]% save rate).

What happened: [Describe what made this post underperform]

Why the algorithm penalized it:
- [Explain the high-comments + low-saves dynamic]
- The algorithm interprets high comments + low saves as controversy, not quality
- [Compare with a top performer to illustrate the difference]

Lesson: Comments alone are NOT algorithm fuel. Saves + DM-sends are. A post
with 100 comments and 5% save rate will outreach a post with 600 comments and 0.1% save rate.

NEVER recommend controversial opinion posts. High comments + zero saves = wasted slot.

### Other Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | What Happens | Alternative |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Generic hooks (e.g. "[niche] tips") | Low curiosity gap, <1% save rate | Specific: "[specific problem statement]" |
| Posting at worst time slot | [avg likes] (worst slot) | Shift to [best time slots] |
| [Best day] Tier 1 content on [worst day] | Wasted on smallest audience | Save Tier 1 for [best days] |
| Over-indexing on low-performing category | Dilutes save rate average | Cap at [X]x/week, use best-performing format |
| Personal content >1x/week | Lowest engagement category | Reserve for pre-launch trust building |
| Copy competitor hooks verbatim | 2026 Originality Score penalizes | Filter through the creator's unique perspective |

---

## 9. Follower Growth Tracking

### Current Growth Rate

| Period | Net New Followers | Daily Average | Growth Rate |
|--------|------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Last 28 days | [number] | [number]/day | [X]%/month |

### Growth Rate Benchmarks

Adjust benchmarks to your niche and follower tier. The thresholds below are general
guidelines; calibrate against competitors in your specific niche.

| Growth Rate | Assessment |
|-------------|-----------|
| >5%/month | Exceptional (top 5% of niche) |
| 2-5%/month | Strong (top 20%) |
| 1-2%/month | Average |
| <1%/month | Stagnating (investigate content or algorithm changes) |

[Your assessment: State your current growth rate tier and what drives it. Example:
"At [X]%/month, the account is in the '[tier]' category. This growth rate is driven
primarily by [top content category] reaching Explore and Reels feed."]

### Growth Tracking Methodology

To track month-over-month growth, run this process on the 1st of each month:

1. Call `get_user_info` to capture current follower count
2. Call `get_user_insights` with `period=days_28` and `metrics=follower_count`
3. Record in the Month-over-Month Tracking Template (Section 10)
4. Calculate: growth rate = (new followers / total followers at month start) * 100
5. Compare with previous month; flag any >2% deviation for investigation
6. If growth drops below [your threshold]/month for 2 consecutive months, trigger full content audit

### Growth Drivers (Ranked by Impact)

Rank your growth drivers by estimated contribution. Update as you gather data.

1. [Top content category] reaching Explore (estimated [X-X]% of new follower acquisition)
2. DM-sends creating secondary distribution loops ([X-X]%)
3. Hashtag discovery ([X-X]%)
4. Story shares and reposts ([X]%)
5. Cross-platform traffic ([X]%)

## 11. KPI Dashboard

### Primary KPIs (Check Weekly)

| KPI | Current | Target | Status |
|-----|---------|--------|--------|
| Save Rate (avg per post) | [X]% | >[X]% | [status] |
| DM-Send Rate (avg per post) | [X]% | >[X]% | [status] |
| Weekly [top category] posts | [X]x | [X]x | [status] |
| 28-Day Reach | [number] | >[target] | [status] |
| Follower Growth Rate | [X]%/month | >[X]%/month | [status] |
| Posts per Week | [X] | [target] | [status] |

### Secondary KPIs (Check Monthly)

| KPI | Current | Target | Status |
|-----|---------|--------|--------|
| Avg Watch Time (Reels) | [X]s | >[X]s | [status] |
| Engagement Rate (likes+comments/followers) | [X]% | >[X]% | [status] |
| Story Reach / Followers | [X]% | >[X]% | [status] |
| [Over-indexed category] share of mix | [X]% | <[X]% | [status] |
| [Under-indexed category] share of mix | [X]% | >[X]% | [status] |
| Controversial posts (save rate <1% + >300 comments) | [frequency] | 0 | [status] |

### Alert Thresholds

Trigger an investigation if any of these occur:
- Save rate drops below [X]% average for 2 consecutive weeks
- Follower growth drops below [X]/day for 1 week
- 28-day reach drops below [X]
- More than 2 posts in a week with save rate <1%
- Any post with >500 comments but <1% save rate (controversy alert)

## 12. Content Pillar Recommendations

### Current vs. Optimal Mix

| Category | Current % | Optimal % | Action |
|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| [TOP CATEGORY] | [X]% | [X-X]% | [Increase/Maintain/Decrease]. [Rationale.] |
| [CATEGORY 2] | [X]% | [X-X]% | [Action. Rationale.] |
| [CATEGORY 3] | [X]% | [X-X]% | [Action. Rationale.] |
| [CATEGORY 4] | [X]% | [X-X]% | [Action. Rationale.] |
| [CATEGORY 5] | [X]% | [X-X]% | [Action. Rationale.] |
| AFFILIATE | [X]% | [X-X]% | [Action. Rationale.] |

### Why Shift from [Over-Indexed Category] to [Under-Indexed Category]

[Explain the optimization opportunity. Use this structure:]

[Over-indexed category] at [X]% of content but only rank [N] in engagement is the biggest
optimization opportunity. Every [over-indexed] post displaces a potential [top category]
or [under-indexed category] post.

Concrete impact of shifting 1 [over-indexed]/week to [under-indexed]:
- Expected save rate increase: [estimate]
- Expected reach increase: [estimate]
- Expected DM-send increase: [estimate]

[Under-indexed category] has [comparable/different] engagement to [top category]
but with only [X]% of content. This suggests the category is not saturated and has
significant room to grow without audience fatigue.

## 13. How to Update This File

### Monthly Baseline Refresh Process

Run this process in the first week of each month. Estimated time: 30-45 minutes.

**Step 1: Pull Current Account Metrics**
```
Call: mcp__claude_ai_Instagram_MCP__get_user_info
Record: followers, following, media_count
```

**Step 2: Pull 28-Day Insights**
```
Call: mcp__claude_ai_Instagram_MCP__get_user_insights
  period: days_28
  metrics: reach, follower_count, total_interactions, likes, comments, shares, saves, views
Record: all values in Section 2 and Month-over-Month table
```

**Step 3: Pull Recent Posts (last 30 days)**
```
Call: mcp__claude_ai_Instagram_MCP__get_user_media (limit=50)
For each post, call: mcp__claude_ai_Instagram_MCP__get_post_insights
Record: per-post likes, saves, shares, comments, reach, watch time
```

**Step 4: Calculate Derived Metrics**
- Avg save rate = sum(saves) / sum(reach) across all posts
- Avg DM-send rate = sum(shares) / sum(reach) across all posts
- Engagement rate = sum(likes + comments) / followers
- Growth rate = net new followers / starting follower count * 100
- Category breakdown: classify each post, calculate per-category averages

**Step 5: Update Sections**
- Section 2: Update all metrics in the "Current Metrics" table
- Section 3: If 100-post analysis is >3 months old, re-run with fresh data
- Section 4: Add any new top performers (save rate >5% or reach >200K)
- Section 8: Add any new anti-patterns observed
- Section 10: Fill in the current month's row
- Section 11: Update KPI dashboard current values and status

**Step 6: Identify Trends**
- Compare this month vs. last month for each KPI
- Flag any metric that changed by >20%
- Note algorithm changes or platform updates that may explain shifts
- Update recommendations in Section 12 if content mix has shifted

**Step 7: Save and Verify**
- Update the "Last updated" date at the top of this file
- Verify all numbers are internally consistent (e.g., growth rate matches follower delta)
- Cross-reference API data with native Instagram Insights app for any discrepancies

### Quarterly Deep Analysis (Every 3 Months)

In addition to the monthly refresh, do a deeper analysis quarterly:

1. Re-run the full 100-post analysis (pull last 100 posts, re-classify, recalculate)
2. Update category performance rankings and sample sizes
3. Refresh engagement rate benchmarks against competitors in your niche
4. Review and update the posting schedule if time-slot performance has shifted
5. Analyze follower demographic changes (age, gender, location) via native app
6. Review top 10 performers of the quarter; extract new hook patterns for hook-library.md
7. Check if weekly content mix recommendation still aligns with data

## 15. Technical Notes

### API Quirks and Workarounds

- `ig_reels_avg_watch_time` returns seconds as a float; round to 1 decimal place
- `shares` in post insights maps to DM-sends (not public shares/reposts)
- `reach` is deduplicated (unique accounts); `impressions` is total views (not available via API)
- Story insights have limited API support; use native app for story-level metrics
- Carousel insights aggregate across all slides; per-slide metrics are not available via API
- When `get_user_media` returns paginated results, use the `after` cursor to get next page
- Business account ID is required for some Graph API endpoints;
  the User ID is used for others. The MCP tools handle this internally.

### Data Freshness

- `get_user_insights` with period=days_28: data is delayed 24-48 hours
- `get_post_insights`: available ~2 hours after posting for initial data; stabilizes after 48h
- `get_user_info`: real-time follower count (but may have +-100 variance due to caching)
- For accurate post performance analysis, wait at least 7 days after posting before
  pulling insights (reach continues to grow for 5-7 days on high-performing posts)

### Calculation Formulas

```
Engagement Rate = (likes + comments) / followers * 100
Save Rate = saves / reach * 100
DM-Send Rate = shares / reach * 100
Follower Growth Rate = net_new_followers / followers_at_start * 100
Reach Multiplier = 28_day_reach / followers
Watch Time Efficiency = avg_watch_time / reel_duration * 100  (completion %)
Content Quality Index = (save_rate * 0.5) + (dm_send_rate * 100 * 0.3) + (engagement_rate * 0.2)
```

The Content Quality Index (CQI) is a composite metric that weights save rate (50%),
DM-send rate (30%), and engagement rate (20%) to produce a single number for
comparing post performance. Higher CQI = better algorithm performance.
